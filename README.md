# Oshirase

A utility for keeping up with the latest anime and manga.

This is primarily a project to learn new technologies.

## Roadmap

### In Progress

* aggregator - A date pipeline written in Rust. Aggregates data from anime/manga lists and sources with recent episode/chapter release information. Data is mainly sourced from the [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/), with other sources being used to supplement this data.

### Planned

* ui - A frontend that will display the data aggregated by the data pipeline. Currently planned to be a web app using TypeScript and Next.js.
* analytics - A project to learn machine learning with Python. Goal is to predict the score for a new anime, given a user's previous anime list scores.
